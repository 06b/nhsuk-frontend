# NHS.UK front-end (IN DEVELOPMENT)

NHS.UK front-end contains the code you need to start building user interfaces for NHS.UK websites and services.

Code and styling examples of NHS.UK front-end components can be found on the <a href="https://nhsuk-redesign.herokuapp.com/">NHS.UK re-design website</a>.

This repository generates shareable CSS and assets for use in NHS.UK websites and services. It also provides development environment for reviewing changes to those assets and the code for the <a href="https://nhsuk-redesign.herokuapp.com/">NHS.UK re-design website</a>.

# Using NHS.UK front-end

To use the NHS.UK in your websites and services there are currently 2 ways:

- You can use the generated and optimised CSS files directly in your application, by downloading the `public/css/nhsuk.css` file,
- or you can download the SCSS files directly from the `scss` folder.
